## PlanetRadio (BauerRadio) Volumio plugin

This Volumio plugin provides more comprehensive access to PlanetRadio (BauerRadio) stations. If you have a BauerRadio premium account you can play extra premium live stations straight from Volumio.


### Credits:

- The actual plugin structure is lifted straight from the hotelradio plugin
- There seems no official documentation of how to interact with the Bauerradio API at all. Eventually I found a squeezebox plugin [Announce Planet Radio / Bauer Media plugin - PlanetRock, Absolute, Kiss, Scala ++](https://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?114252-Announce-Planet-Radio-Bauer-Media-plugin-PlanetRock-Absolute-Kiss-Scala). The source code was very useful in figuring out at least some of the interactions...
