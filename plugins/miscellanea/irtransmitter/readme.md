***IR-Transmitter Volumio plugin***

Enables support for an IR transmitter connected to your Volumio system.

Do you have your Volumio connected to a good old fashioned stereo amplifier/sound system which can only remote controlled using an infra-red remote control?
I'm sure there must be plenty of others who like me would love to be able to control their amp straight using the Volumio web interface from their mobile/tablet/PC rather than having to track down that bloody remote...

Thanks to the COVID-19 lock-down I finally found the time to get this to work on my system, and maybe other find it useful.
